      <p class="lead"><strong>Choose the right tool for the job. Smartly.</strong></p>
      <p class="lead">Yes, we all know that - Choose the right tool for the job,
        but unfortunatly, that is sometimes much easier said than done.
      </p>
      <p class="lead"> <strong>devdev</strong> is a tool for software developers with the goal of making this selection just a
        little bit easier, fun and productive.
        devdev allows you to <em>Choose the right tool for the job. <strong>Smartly.</strong></em>
      </p>
      <p>As software developers, when choosing the right tool for the job you usually ask yourself the following and similar questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the tools available for this domain?</li>
        <li>How do the differnet tools compare?</li>
        <li>Which tool is better for what job?</li>
        <li>What is the vendor of the tool does not tell me? (Or what does an open source developer of the tool does not tell me?)</li>
        <li>Where do I find non-vendor critique / praise for the tool?</li>
        <li>Is this tool part of a large ecosystem? How does this echosystem or technology stack fit in with my current stack?</li>
        <li>If I choose this tool, will I be limited in the set of technologies to come?</li>
        <li>What prerequisites does this tool have? Do I need to master a certain language? Does it mean that I can't deploy to heroku? In general, what sort of limitation am I committing to when choosing this tool?</li>
        <li>How large and healthy is the community around this tool?</li>
        <li>What needs and use cases does this tool answer well?</li>
        <li>What needs and use cases does thos tool NOT answer very well? (you won't find this on the vendor's site)</li>
        <li>How do I get started with minimal effort?</li>
        <li>Where do I find blog posts, tutorial, mailing list, StackOverflow, facebook, twitter etc?</li>
        <li>How many other developers are using it alreay?</li>
        <li>Is anyone of my friends already using it? Or even tried it? (I could just give her a call...)</li>
        <li><em>Alright, you get it, and there are tons more questions of that kind</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The common practice when evaluating a technlogy for the first time is to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google that thing. Find the official docs and start reading</li>
        <li>Try a simple Hello World, see if you can get it to work</li>
        <li>Try something more sophisticated, maybe a benchmark with something specific to your use case.</li>
        <li>Search for blog posts and see what develpers already using this technology are saying about it</li>
        <li>Try to find the oponents of this technology and see why. Do you have similar use cases? Are their objections valid for your case?</li>
        <li>Try to search for similar or competitive technology. Google searches such as "X vs" and see what google autocompletes (it works really well sometimes)</li>
        <li><em>Etc etc, continue your research until you're ready to move on to a prototype or ditch the tool</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>One of the challanges with this approach is that it can be very time comsuming.
        And you need some very good google skills to make the searches work well for you.
        Usually you need to read the docs and get prepared very well in order to get
        to the conclusion that the tool fits / or does not fit your use cases.
        As with Lean Startup, in development too, you want to make sure that you invest
        the right amount of energy in your task and you don't waste your most precious resource - time,
        on something that could be done in less time.
        We call it <strong>Minimum Viable Work (MVW)</strong> , the minimal amount of work/time you invest in getting to the conclusion that
        the tool fits / or does not fit your need. The minimum amount of time you invest
        in order to reaslize there's another, more appropriate tool for the job.
        The minimum amount of time you invest in order to learn what other technologycal assumption
        does this tool bring to your stack. <strong>devdev</strong> is trying to answer all of that. The goal of devdev is to provide the right
        information in a compact and effective way so that you could actually implement
        MVW and enjoy at the process while at it.
      </p>
      <p><small>devdev's goal is to help you get started, introduced, to new technologies.
        It is by no means a replacement to writing your own benchmark and making a
        more thorough reseach per your specific use case.
        It does, however, want to minimize your up front investment, before you choose to
        devote more time and energy or alternatively ditch the tool and move on.
        So you should think of devdev as a tool for getting started, for spending your
        first five minutes; And as a tool for discovering alternatives to the
        technoligy at hand.</small>

      <h2>How does devdev work?</h2>
      <p>devdev is intended to be a community effort; It's source code is <a href="https://github.com/rantav/devdev">on github</a> and the service itself is run free by Ran.
        devdev is a <strong>wiki</strong> style <strong>smart directory</strong> of software technologies.
        This means that in true open source spirit it is open to contribution for everyone - Just
        log in (using Google or GitHub) and start contributing. It's easy enough to
        either create a new listing for your favorite technology, or just add aspects to
        existing technologies. (aspects such as "docs", "tutorials", "competitive technologies" etc).
        As a contributor you will be acknowledged for your work in a fully transparent way.
        See the <a href="/users">Contributors page</a>. As a casual visitor we hope to provide a good coverage of the technologies
        you're interested in and be smart about it - for example tell you which other technologies
        are in the same stack and which other technologies are competing or alternatives
        to your tech.
        The only way this can be done is by building a healthy and floorishing community,
        and this is where you can help! Join our community simply by logging in and contributing
        and please let us know about your feedback.
      </p>
      <p><small>While devdev is faithful to the open source spirit in its contribution model,
        we do accept and are happy to have commercial technology and tools listed as well.
        After all, we all just want to get the job done using the right tools and there's
        no point in restricting the set of tools in any way.</small>

      <h2>About the creator</h2>
      <p>devdev was created by <a href="http://tavory.com">Ran Tavory</a> who had been developing web services for years.
        Ran is a software developer and a software technology junkie.
        He loves to read about new technologies, play with them, evaluate them and sharpen his tools.
        But more than that, Ran likes to ship stuff and make it available to millions of
        web users.
        In doing so, Ran has many times got frustrated when evaluating a new
        technology, hoping to find the right tool for the job. He had been practicing his
        google voodoo for many years (and indeed it got better) but after having done this
        for years he had realized that there must be a better way to bootstrap into
        new and exciting technologies with the Minimum Viable Work.
        With this goal in mind, Ran had created devdev as a community service, and
        as a personal hobby, hoping to make the world better, one technology at a time...

      <h2>Prior Art / Inspiration / Similar Work</h2>
      <p>devdev was not created in a vacuum. There had been services and attempts to
        solve the same problem or similar problems in the field of software development
        or other fields.
        The following websites had served as inspiration to this service, or were
        later discovered and referred to as Similar Work.
        None of which, by the way, presents the right solution to the problem of <em>Finding the right tool for the job, <strong>smartly</strong></em>, but they all in one way or another
        do at least attempt to approach this or similar problems with varying degree
        of success.
        These are: <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/">ohloh</a>, <a href="http://codevisually.com/">codevisually</a>, <a href="http://queues.io">queues.io</a>, <a href="http://alternativeto.net/">alternativeto</a>, <a href="http://solr-vs-elasticsearch.com/">solr-vs-elasticsearch</a>. And of course there are many other tools not mentioned here, this list is
        just to serve as point of reference for grasping the field of
        "finding the right tool for the job".
